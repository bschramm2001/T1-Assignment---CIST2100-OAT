 ##### Channels: 
 We will connect our customer segments by offering referral bonuses and discounts. Also as our company grows and more people have Maverick Monitoring it will connect communities by notifing of neighboring break ins. We believe this will retain and bring in more customers with minimal spent of direct advertisment. 
We will channel first through advertisment on TV. I will use TV as main form of advertisment because most people watching TV will be in their home at the time. They will evaluate value by considering the new level of protection and support from our systems. A customer is buying peace of mind knowing their home is more secure when using our products. Our support is going to be shown by our call center and support teams that assist with technical issues or will call police for you in case of a break in. We will also wish to get more customers by offering a referal system.

##### Customer Relationships:
Maintaining customers requires us to assist them with our products when it is needed. For example during a break in our company must be on top of trying to contact police and home owner. We will rely on fast and accurate response to situations to keep our customers. We want easy to use products that all property owners can easily understand and use. If a customer moves we want the to transfer our technology to their new residence because of our companies quality care.
These will fit well with our business idea because our business is built on customer care and relations. Without good customer relations and our call center then our company will not stand out as better compared to other home security companies.
