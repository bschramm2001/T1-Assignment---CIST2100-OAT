##### Customer Segments:
Our customer segment are people who own/rent a property that has an internet connection. This can be a business or a home. Mavrick Monitoring will appeal to them because they will want to protect themselves against crime, fire, and monoxide poisioning. Maverick Monitoring will be more appealing compared to our competitors because Maverick Monitoring will also have a call center which can talk to police in real time and give descriptions of a break in. Maverick Monitoring will also be building a large tattoo and face recognition database to deter and catch habitual criminals. Customers without an internet connection can still use the technology however some features will not be compatible without an internet connection.

When a break in happens and the home owner is not home to respond our call center will look at the footage in real time and give police the address and a description of the criminal. If an arrest is not made at the time of the crime all break ins will be logged into our database to connect habitual criminals and assist police in identification processes.

Over the next five years we hope our products will be cheaper to buy so installation prices goes down. We
