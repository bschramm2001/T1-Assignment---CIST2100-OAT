 Team Maverick Monitoring / Group 2
 
 ------------------------------ Assignment 1-----------------------------------------------------

#Task 1: Team leader Ben Schramm
 
 #Task 2: Our customer segment are people who own/rent a property that has an internet connection. This can be a business or a home. Mavrick Monitoring will appeal to them because they will want to protect themselves against crime, fire, and monoxide poisioning. Maverick Monitoring will be more appealing compared to our competitors because Maverick Monitoring will also have a call center which can talk to police in real time and give descriptions of a break in. Maverick Monitoring will also be building a large tattoo and face recognition database to deter and catch habitual criminals. Customers without an internet connection can still use the technology however some features will not be compatible without an internet connection. 
 
 #Task 3: We will have mostly online sales, as the company grows we will start opening in-person stores but in the beginning installation of our products can be out sourced. When you buy into Maverick Monitoring you will get the physical hardware technology including dection devices and cameras, the online mobile app which notifies you of any detection and will give you access to home security cameras at any time, and the call centers protection and police notifications in case of a break in and the home owner is not there. We also hope to do some contracting for big businesses with a lot of locations
 
 #Task 4: Any property owner has the fear of break-ins, fire, and monoxide poisoning. While detection technology has been out for a while Maverick Monitoring will be taking a big leap in providing customers with the most protection. A home owner can look at security footage anytime and play back footage. When a break in happens and the home owner is not home to respond our call center will look at the footage in real time and give police the address and a description of the criminal. If an arrest is not made at the time of the crime all break ins will be logged into our database to connect habitual criminals and assist police in identification processes. 
 
 #Task 5: Our initial line of products includes the three detection systems, HD cameras, and access to the online app after purchase. The ammount of detection systems and cameras needed for a building or home depends on the size however installation is a set price then the property owner can make a decision on how many cameras is needed for security followed by a small monthly reaccuring fee. Over the next five years we hope our products will be cheaper to buy so installation prices goes down. We also for our product to grow into more than just the best security, we would like to make our app community based. An example of this would be in five years when more people have our systems install if one persons house is broken into down the street it will notify people also using Maverick Monitoring that a house close to them is currently being broken into.

 #Task 1: Ben Schramm
 
 #Task 2: We will connect our customer segments by offering referal bonuses and discounts. Also as our company grows and more people have Maverick Monitoring it will connect communities by notifing of neighboring break ins. We believe this will retain and bring in more customers with minimal spent of direct advertisment. 
 
 #Task 3: We will chanel first through advertisment on TV. I will use TV as main form of advertisment because most people watching TV will be in their home at the time. They will evaluate value by considering the new level of protection and support from our systems. A customer is buying peace of mind knowing their home is more secure when using our products. Our support is going to be shown by our call center and support teams that assist with technical issues or will call police for you in case of a break in. We will also wish to get more customers by offering a referal system.
 
 #Task 4: Maintaining customers requires us to assist them with our products when it is needed. For example during a break in our company must be on top of trying to contact police and home owner. We will rely on fast and accurate response to situations to keep our customers. We want easy to use products that all property owners can easily understand and use. If a customer moves we want the to transfer our technology to their new residence because of our companies quality care. 
 
 #Task 5: These will fit well with our business idea because our business is built on customer care and relations. Without good customer relations and our call center then our company will not stand out as better compared to other home security companies.

#Task 1: Andy Andi Lolo

#Task 2: Our key activities would be developing physical as well as digital product that would work together seamlessly. Because of the nature of our security product, we would have to develop high definition security cameras, equipped with many other security features such as infra-red for in the dark visibility, facial recognition, audio recognition, and so on. With that being said, our digital products would work in sync with our physical cameras installed in our customer's properties. A high quality, user friendly mobile application that can monitor thru the camera in real time, giving our customers their best sense of security for properties they own.

#Task 3: For our physical cameras, we would acquire them through an outsourced factory with an experience in producing cameras with suitable networking and computing capabilities. For intellectual resources, we would seek a leading security advisor who has been in the security industry for an extensive time. For human workforce, we would hire and train installation and maintenance technicians for our physical products, as well as talented programmers to develop our cutting edge mobile security platform. As for financial resources, we would seek angel investors to initially fund our project, along with maintaining a feasible cash flow to keep the business growing and running.

#Task 4: Our business will be based on a monthly subscription fee, with an initial installation fee to set up the camera(s). Customers would have their own personal accounts which they are able to sign in with using the Maverick Monitoring mobile application to monitor the security of their properties. Cameras installed in the properties are connected via Wi-Fi to our privatized server, which then feeds customer's live information about their properties. Customers has the ability to put down a work order if they need a maintenance request about their cameras. From this network, administration side are able to look over all the accounts through a company database.

#Task 5: Our business operation activities and resources would work seamlessly considering the simplicity of how our product is run. The key to this business is a physical and digital product working in harmony to produce the upmost sense of security for our customers.
