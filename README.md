 Team Maverick Monitoring / Group 2
 
 ------------------------------ Assignment 1-----------------------------------------------------

#Task 1: Team leader Ben Schramm
 
 #Task 2: Our customer segment are people who own/rent a property that has an internet connection. This can be a business or a home. Mavrick Monitoring will appeal to them because they will want to protect themselves against crime, fire, and monoxide poisioning. Maverick Monitoring will be more appealing compared to our competitors because Maverick Monitoring will also have a call center which can talk to police in real time and give descriptions of a break in. Maverick Monitoring will also be building a large tattoo and face recognition database to deter and catch habitual criminals. Customers without an internet connection can still use the technology however some features will not be compatible without an internet connection. 
 
 #Task 3: We will have mostly online sales, as the company grows we will start opening in-person stores but in the beginning installation of our products can be out sourced. When you buy into Maverick Monitoring you will get the physical hardware technology including dection devices and cameras, the online mobile app which notifies you of any detection and will give you access to home security cameras at any time, and the call centers protection and police notifications in case of a break in and the home owner is not there. We also hope to do some contracting for big businesses with a lot of locations
 
 #Task 4: Any property owner has the fear of break-ins, fire, and monoxide poisoning. While detection technology has been out for a while Maverick Monitoring will be taking a big leap in providing customers with the most protection. A home owner can look at security footage anytime and play back footage. When a break in happens and the home owner is not home to respond our call center will look at the footage in real time and give police the address and a description of the criminal. If an arrest is not made at the time of the crime all break ins will be logged into our database to connect habitual criminals and assist police in identification processes. 
 
 #Task 5: Our initial line of products includes the three detection systems, HD cameras, and access to the online app after purchase. The ammount of detection systems and cameras needed for a building or home depends on the size however installation is a set price then the property owner can make a decision on how many cameras is needed for security followed by a small monthly reaccuring fee. Over the next five years we hope our products will be cheaper to buy so installation prices goes down. We also for our product to grow into more than just the best security, we would like to make our app community based. An example of this would be in five years when more people have our systems install if one persons house is broken into down the street it will notify people also using Maverick Monitoring that a house close to them is currently being broken into.

 #Task 1: Ben Schramm
 
 #Task 2: We will connect our customer segments by offering referal bonuses and discounts. Also as our company grows and more people have Maverick Monitoring it will connect communities by notifing of neighboring break ins. We believe this will retain and bring in more customers with minimal spent of direct advertisment. We believe that when our community is strongly interconnected through means such as the internet, it would connect our consumer segments in a efficient and effective way.
 
 #Task 3: We will chanel first through advertisment on TV. I will use TV as main form of advertisment because most people watching TV will be in their home at the time. They will evaluate value by considering the new level of protection and support from our systems. A customer is buying peace of mind knowing their home is more secure when using our products. Our support is going to be shown by our call center and support teams that assist with technical issues or will call police for you in case of a break in. We will also wish to get more customers by offering a referal system.
 
 #Task 4: Maintaining customers requires us to assist them with our products when it is needed. For example during a break in our company must be on top of trying to contact police and home owner. We will rely on fast and accurate response to situations to keep our customers. We want easy to use products that all property owners can easily understand and use. If a customer moves we want the to transfer our technology to their new residence because of our companies quality care. 
 
 #Task 5: These will fit well with our business idea because our business is built on customer care and relations. Without good customer relations and our call center then our company will not stand out as better compared to other home security companies. As providers of personal property security, we always have to be available and accessible to everyone we serve.
